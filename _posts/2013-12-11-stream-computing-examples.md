### Stream Computing - Examples
#### General Examples
* Monitoring streams of low-level sensor inputs and emitting high-level interpretations of the raw data
* Responding to streams emanating from sensor inputs by emitting actuator commands
* Monitoring streams of data from Intrusion Detection sensor inputs and emitting alerts
* Monitoring streams of video data and interpreting scenes, scene changes, etc.

#### InfoSphere Streams Examples
* Traffic control system which takes in GPS information from public vehicles and caculates deviations from normal to recommend alternative routes
* Real-time correlation of information from multiple neonatal ICU monitors to detect potential life threatening conditions up to 24 hours earlier than an experienced ICU nurse
