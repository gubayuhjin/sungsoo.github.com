Related Architecture

CEP is used for event processing within an *event-driven architecture*. Unlike a simple event processing or event stream processing mechanism, CEP uses *event-correlation* and *pattern-matching* techniques to “**infer**” complex events. It augments business *activity monitoring with inferences* from source events treated as business events and sent for further action or analysis via dashboards. In business process management, CEP is used as an enrichment system that reports business events as they occur. Threats and opportunities are reported to further workflows. In a service-oriented architecture, CEP systems can be used to determine the business trigger to launch further services in the processing pipeline.


DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

In building CEP applications, designers can employ a set of common building blocks. A typical CEP architecture would be as follows:
