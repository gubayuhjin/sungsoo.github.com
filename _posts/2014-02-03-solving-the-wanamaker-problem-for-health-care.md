>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.  
- John Wanamaker (1838-1922)

The consumer *Internet revolution* was fueled by a search for the answer to **Wanamaker’s question**. Google AdWords and the pay-per-click model began the transformation of a business in which advertisers paid for ad impressions into one in which they pay for results. “*Cost per thousand impressions*” (**CPM**) was outperformed by “*cost per click*” (**CPC**), and a new industry was born. It’s important to un‐ derstand why CPC outperformed CPM, though. Superficially, it’s be‐ cause Google was able to track when a user clicked on a link, and was therefore able to bill based on success. But billing based on success doesn’t fundamentally change anything unless you can also change the success rate, and that’s what Google was able to do. By using data to understand each user’s behavior, Google was able to place advertise‐ ments that an individual was likely to click. They knew “which half ” of their advertising was more likely to be effective, and didn’t bother with the rest.References
