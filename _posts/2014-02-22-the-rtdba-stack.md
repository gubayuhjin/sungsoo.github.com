The RTDBA Stack
---

At this moment, it’s clear that an architecture for handling RTBDA is slowly emerging from a disparate set of programs and tools. What isn’t clear, however, is what that architecture will look like. One goal of this paper is sketching out a practical RTBDA roadmap that will serve a variety of stakeholders including users, vendors, investors, and cor‐ porate executives such as CIOs, CFOs and COOs who make or influ‐ ence purchasing decisions around information technology.Focusing on the stakeholders and their needs is important because it reminds us that the RTBDA technology exists for a specific purpose: creating value from data. It is also important to remember that “value” and “real time” will suggest different meanings to different subsets of stakeholders. There is presently no one-size-fits-all model, which makes sense when you consider that the interrelationships among people, processes and technologies within the RTBDA universe are still evolving.David Smith writes a popular blog for Revolution Analytics on open source R, a programming language designed specifically for data an‐ alytics. He proposes a four-layer RTBDA technology stack. Although his stack is geared for predictive analytics, it serves as a good general model:
