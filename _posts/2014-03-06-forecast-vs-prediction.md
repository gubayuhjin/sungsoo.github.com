Forecast Vs. Prediction. What’s the difference?
---

The two words are certainly synonymous to one another, but exist equally apart.

A *prediction* is most often centered around the idea of an outcome based on *deductive logic* or *beliefs* rather than the approach.

If you’re running an ecommerce business now, it’s reasonable to predict you will have more traffic while approaching the holiday season. You could even go far enough to say you will make more money because of this sudden surge in traffic to your site. None of these predictions are necessarily wrong, but the scope and foundation of its reason doesn’t go far beyond your intuition and logic – similar to the palm-reading gypsy you encountered.

A *forecast* is a means to *validating a prediction* based on an analysis of varying factors and *patterns*, showing you how you got to this future logic or belief. Hence the usage of a forecast in lieu of a prediction, within the world of business information.

Using the same example above but with forecasting: You’re running the same business approaching the same holiday season. You can still predict your site will get more sales and traffic over the course of the holidays, but this time you also take into account your quantitative marketing data, or the data encompassing said logic. You now see that weekdays generate more revenue than weekends, how long the site’s holiday season lasts and even calculate how much more money you could make during this season compared to the rest of the year. These findings and calculations from your site’s past create a solid, data-driven bedrock for your initial prediction, justifying its credibility and molding it into a forecast.
