# A Data Science Profile
In the class, Rachel handed out index cards and asked everyone to profile themselves (on a relative rather than absolute scale) with re‐ spect to their skill levels in the following domains:
* Computer science
* Math
* Statistics
* Machine learning
* Domain expertise
* Communication and presentation skills
* Data visualization


As an example, Figure 1-2 shows Rachel’s data science profile.

We taped the index cards to the blackboard and got to see how every‐ one else thought of themselves. There was quite a bit of variation, which is cool—lots of people in the class were coming from social sciences, for example.Where is your data science profile at the moment, and where would you like it to be in a few months, or years?As we mentioned earlier, a data science team works best when different skills (profiles) are represented across different people, because no‐ body is good at everything. It makes us wonder if it might be more worthwhile to define a “data science team”—as shown in Figure 1-3— than to define a data scientist.
