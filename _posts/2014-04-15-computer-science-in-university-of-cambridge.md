Computer science is a fast-moving field that brings together many disciplines, including mathematics, programming, engineering, the natural sciences, psychology and linguistics. 

Our course provides you with a skillset that's highly prized in industry and for academic research. All aspects of modern computer science are covered, along with the underlying theory and foundations in economics, law and business. You also develop practical skills, such as programming (in various languages, e.g. ML, Java, C/C++, Prolog) and hardware systems (e.g. chip design using Verilog).

Some of the students who appear in our course films are also featured in the 60 Second Impressions series, which can be found at [http://www.cam.ac.uk/60 seconds/](http://www.cam.ac.uk/60 seconds/) - keep checking back as we'll be adding new films every couple of weeks!
