Optiq
=====

Optiq is a dynamic data management framework.

Prerequisites
=============

Optiq requires git, maven (3.0.4 or later), and JDK 1.6 or later (JDK 1.7 preferred).

Download and build
==================

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/julianhyde/optiq.git
$ cd optiq
$ mvn install
```

Use `mvn -DskipTests` if you do not want to execute the tests.

Example
=======

Optiq makes data anywhere, of any format, look like a database. For
example, you can execute a complex ANSI-standard SQL statement on
in-memory collections:

```java
public static class HrSchema {
  public final Employee[] emps = ... ;
  public final Department[] depts = ...;
}
Class.forName("net.hydromatic.optiq.jdbc.Driver");
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:optiq:");
OptiqConnection optiqConnection =
    connection.unwrap(OptiqConnection.class);
ReflectiveSchema.create(optiqConnection,
    optiqConnection.getRootSchema(), "hr", new HrSchema());
Statement statement = optiqConnection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(
    "select d.\"deptno\", min(e.\"empid\")\n"
    + "from \"hr\".\"emps\" as e\n"
    + "join \"hr\".\"depts\" as d\n"
    + "  on e.\"deptno\" = d.\"deptno\"\n"
    + "group by d.\"deptno\"\n"
    + "having count(*) > 1");
print(resultSet);
resultSet.close();
statement.close();
connection.close();
```

Where is the database? There is no database. The connection is
completely empty until <code>ReflectiveSchema.create</code> registers
a Java object as a schema and its collection fields <code>emps</code>
and <code>depts</code> as tables.

Optiq does not want to own data; it does not even have favorite data
format. This example used in-memory data sets, and processed them
using operators such as <code>groupBy</code> and <code>join</code>
from the linq4j
library. But Optiq can also process data in other data formats, such
as JDBC. In the first example, replace

```java
ReflectiveSchema.create(optiqConnection,
    optiqConnection.getRootSchema(), "hr", new HrSchema());
```

with

```java
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost");
dataSource.setUsername("sa");
dataSource.setPassword("");
JdbcSchema.create(optiqConnection, dataSource, rootSchema, "hr", "");
```

and Optiq will execute the same query in JDBC. To the application, the
data and API are the same, but behind the scenes the implementation is
very different. Optiq uses optimizer rules
to push the <code>JOIN</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code> operations to
the source database.

In-memory and JDBC are just two familiar examples. Optiq can handle
any data source and data format. To add a data source, you need to
write an adapter that tells Optiq
what collections in the data source it should consider "tables".

For more advanced integration, you can write optimizer
rules. Optimizer rules allow Optiq to access data of a new format,
allow you to register new operators (such as a better join algorithm),
and allow Optiq to optimize how queries are translated to
operators. Optiq will combine your rules and operators with built-in
rules and operators, apply cost-based optimization, and generate an
efficient plan.
