# Data Governance Initiative 

Ensuring a common approach to data governance across all systems and
data

Enterprises that include Hadoop in their modern data architecture must
address certain realities when bringing legacy and new data from
disparate platforms under management in their cluster.

The Data Governance Initiative is working to develop an extensible
foundation that addresses enterprise requirements for comprehensive data
governance and assures that Hadoop:

-   Snaps into existing frameworks to openly exchange metadata
-   Addresses enterprise data governance requirements within its own
    stack of technologies

The DGI solution will feature deep integration with [Apache
Falcon](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/falcon/) for data lifecycle
management and [Apache Ranger](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/ranger/)
for centralized security policies. It will also interoperate with and
extend existing third-party data governance and management tools by
shedding light on the data access patterns within the Hadoop cluster.

In addition to Hortonworks, the members of DGI are enterprise Hadoop
users Aetna, JPMorganChase, Merck, Schlumberger, and Target and also
Hortonworksâ€™ technology partner
[SAS](http://hortonworks.com/partner/SAS/).
