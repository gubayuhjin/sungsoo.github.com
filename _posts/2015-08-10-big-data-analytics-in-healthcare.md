In this webinar, speakers from WellCare, Attunity and Pivotal will discuss how WellCare uses Attunity Replicate to offload data quickly and easily from its SQL Server and Oracle systems into Pivotal Greenplum Database to support real-time reporting and analytics.

To reach this milestone in its big data initiative, WellCare first had to overcome several challenges. This session will outline their journey and detail how it has resulted in accelerating reporting schedules by 73% (from 30 days down to only 8 days) for better, more accurate operational decision making. The effort has also improved data availability and accuracy throughout the enterprise to support decisions on future healthcare planning for members, while ensuring that WellCare is in compliance with ACA and other state and federal regulations. The presenters will also discuss Wellcareâ€™s plan going forward to introduce a Hadoop data lake.
