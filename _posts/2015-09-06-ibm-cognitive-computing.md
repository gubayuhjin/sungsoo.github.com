# Cognitive Computing

This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Jerome Pesenti, lead developer of IBM’s Jeopardy-winning Watson supercomputer, says development of software relying on natural language and machine learning needs new ways of gathering and treating data.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
