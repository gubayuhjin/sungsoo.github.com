# Big Data and Machine Learning - Keys to AI Progress

**After a short pause, I would like to go back to artificial
intelligence advances and learning algorithms. Moreover, it is almost
every day that we get to know about progress made in this field. All the
top technology firms including Google, Facebook, IBM and Baidu are
diving deeper into the subject with the more and more stunning
results.**

Still for the algorithms to learn, big amounts of data are required. As
[stated at the very beginning of
2015](http://anrcloud.com/index.php/9-news/33-a-new-technological-year-to-come),
big data is one of the technologies of the year that deserves the most
attention and hype. Amazing thing is that big data volumes are now
specially created for algorithm learning purposes. And, as explained by
the MIT Technology Review, it is “easier said than done”[[i]](#_edn1),
as for natural language processing text databases should be annotated so
that algorithms could parse through the volumes of data. “The annotation
must describe the content of the text but without appearing within it.
To understand the link, a learning algorithm must then look beyond the
mere occurrence of words and phrases but also at their grammatical links
and causal relationships”[[ii]](#_edn2).

Google DeepMind, a pioneer in the domain, have opted for a different and
organic solution – they process articles from Daily Mail and CNN online
that have typical organization and structure and allow algorithms to
learn the pattern easily. Also, such content is authentic and available
in big volumes. The database has been used for comparing traditional NLP
techniques measuring the distance between combinations of words and the
[neural network approaches that we have extensively discussed this
year](http://anrcloud.com/index.php/9-news/48-speech-recognition-and-natural-language-processing-taking-advantage-of-deep-learning),
with the result that is not surprising but convincing. It “clearly shows
how powerful neural nets have become … the best neural nets can answer
60 percent of the queries put to them”[[iii]](#_edn3).

Other experiments show even more impressive results. TechCrunch and
WIRED have both reported Facebook’s and Google’s artificial intelligence
advances in the area of image recognition. Neural networks are not only
capable of recognizing images but can also follow the pattern for
re-constructing images. According to Rob Fergus, Facebook artificial
intelligence researcher, “It understands the structure of how images
work”[[iv]](#_edn4). And the experiments go even further. To make the
learning process closer to the one of the human brain, the researchers
confront two neural networks: “one network is built to recognize natural
images, and the other does its best to fool the first”[[v]](#_edn5).
This process is also available after the neural networks process a big
number of images and make out patterns of the huge databases.

But why is it so important to have a structured data corpus in order to
make intelligent algorithms learn? What does it bring? The example of
machine translation techniques explained by the New York Times
Magazine[[vi]](#_edn6) shows clearly how it works.

In translation it is often all about context. Traditional rule-based
machine translation took the context into account, but it also bases on
the glossary and takes the terms’ translations in there. The statistical
strategy (like the one behind [Google and Microsoft instant translation
solutions](http://anrcloud.com/index.php/9-news/34-immediate-translation-available-now-with-google-translate-new-features))
pays more attention to the context and environment. The following
example shows extensively how it works: “The English word “bank,” to use
one frequent example, can mean either “financial institution” or “side
of a river,” but these are two distinct words in French. When should it
be translated as “*banque*,” when as “*rive*”? A probabilistic model
will have the computer examine a few of the other words nearby. If your
sentence elsewhere contains the words “money” or “robbery,” the proper
translation is probably “*banque*.”[[vii]](#_edn7)

***All these achievements mean that artificial intelligence continue to
make its place in the modern world and the neural networks are learning
fast enough to be able to process lots of available data and produce
knowledge and experience. Once again, it is in the combination of
technologies in a powerful solution that help the researchers to
progress and go further with even more intelligent algorithms.***
