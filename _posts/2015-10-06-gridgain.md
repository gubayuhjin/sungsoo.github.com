# GridGain In-Memory Data Fabric

<blockquote>In-Memory Computing uses high-performance, integrated, distributed memory systems to compute and transact on large-scale data sets in real-time, orders of magnitude faster than possible with traditional disk-based or flash technologies.
</blockquote>

GridGainâ€™s In-Memory Data Fabric is designed to deliver uncompromised performance for a widest set of in-memory computing use cases from high performance computing, to the industry most advanced data grid, to streaming and plug-n-play Hadoop accelerator:

## In-Memory Data Grid
Natively distributed, ACID transactional, MVCC-based, SQL+NoSQL, in-memory object key-value store. The only in-memory data grid proven to scale to billions of transactions per second on commodity hardware.

## In-Memory Streaming
Massively distributed processing meets Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Streaming Processing with advanced workflow support, windowing, user-defined indexes and more.

## In-Memory Accelerator for Hadoop
Combination of In-Memory File System 100% compatible with Hadoop HDFS and In-Memory MapReduce delivering 100x performance increase. Minimal integration, plug-n-play acceleration with any Hadoop distro.

## Maven Install
The easiest way to get started with GridGain in your project is to use Maven dependency management:

## Fabric Edition
`Fabric` edition includes all GridGain functionality except for `hadoop accelerator`.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.gridgain</groupId>
    <artifactId>gridgain-fabric</artifactId>
    <version>${gridgain.version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

## Legacy Editions
Following editions are supported for legacy downloads and projects started before `Fabric` edition has been introduced. It is strongly recommended to use `Fabric` edition.

### HPC Edition
`HPC` edition includes all GridGain functionality except for `data grid`, `streaming` and `hadoop accelerator`.

### Data Grid Edition
`Data Grid` edition includes all GridGain functionality except for `streaming` and `hadoop accelerator`.

### Streaming Edition
`Streaming` edition includes all GridGain functionality except for `data grid` and `hadoop accelerator`.

You can copy and paste this snippet into your Maven POM file. Make sure to replace version with the one you need.
