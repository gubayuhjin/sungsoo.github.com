An Energy Efficient and Massively Parallel Approach to Valid Numerics
===


In this slidecast, John Gustafson presents: An Energy Efficient and Massively Parallel Approach to Valid Numerics.

"Written by one of the foremost experts in high-performance computing and the inventor of Gustafsonâ€™s Law, The End of Error: Unum Computing explains a new approach to computer arithmetic: the universal number (unum). The unum encompasses all IEEE floating-point formats as well as fixed-point and exact integer arithmetic. This new number type obtains more accurate answers than floating-point arithmetic yet uses fewer bits in many cases, saving memory, bandwidth, energy, and power."
