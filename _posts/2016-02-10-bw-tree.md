# The Bw-Tree Key-Value Store

## Abstract

The emergence of new hardware and platforms has led to reconsideration of how data management systems are designed. However, certain basic functions such as *key indexed access* to records remain essential. While we exploit the common architectural layering of prior systems, we make radically new design decisions about each layer. Our new form of B-tree, called the **[Bw-tree](http://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/bwtree-icde2013.pdf)** achieves its very high performance via a *latch-free approach* that effectively exploits the processor caches of modern multi-core chips. Our storage manager uses a unique form of log structuring that blurs the distinction between a page and a record store and works well with flash storage. This paper describes the architecture and algorithms for the Bw-tree, focusing on the *main memory aspects*. The paper includes results of our experiments that demonstrate that this fresh approach produces outstanding performance.
