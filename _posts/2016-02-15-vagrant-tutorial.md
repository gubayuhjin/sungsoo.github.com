# Vagrant Tutorial 
## Running a VM For Your Local Development Environment 

Vagrant and VM's can RADICALLY shape your development workflow. Instead of every developer working on their own local server with their own configuration, you can configure a portable local environment that exactly mirrors your staging and production environments. Now developers can spin up this environment on their machine and work completely locally without having to change their machine configuration to accommodate the project they're working on. Also, each project they work on can have it's own VM running it's own configuration that they can spin up.

Also, Vagrant provides an easy-to-destroy environment to practice your Linux server administration skills!
