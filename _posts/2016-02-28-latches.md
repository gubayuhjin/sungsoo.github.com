# Latches

Locks held for a short duration are typically called **latches**. Latches do not follow the usual concurrency control protocol such as two-phase locking. For example, a latch can be used to guarantee the physical integrity of a disk page when that page is being written from the buffer to disk. A latch would be acquired for the *page*, the page written to disk, and then the latch released.
