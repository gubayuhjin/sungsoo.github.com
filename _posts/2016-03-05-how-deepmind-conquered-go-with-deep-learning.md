# How DeepMind Conquered Go With Deep Learning 


This time around, *Google DeepMind* embarked on a journey to write an algorithm that plays Go. Go is an ancient chinese board game where the opposing players try to capture each other's stones on the board. Behind the veil of this deceptively simple ruleset, lies an enormous layer of *depth* and *complexity*. As scientists like to say, the search space of this problem is significantly larger than that of chess. So large, that one often has to rely on human intuition to find a suitable next move, therefore it is not surprising that playing Go on a high level is, or maybe was widely believed to be intractable for machines. The result is Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, the *deep learning technique* that defeated a professional player and European champion, Fan Hui.
