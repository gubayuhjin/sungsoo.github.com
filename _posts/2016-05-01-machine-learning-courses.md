Practicals
----------

Please click on Timetables on the right hand side of this page for time
and location of the practicals. The instructors are [Brendan
Shillingford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/brendan.shillingford/) and
Marcin Moczulsky.

Practicals will use
[Torch](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet), a powerful
programming framework for deep learning that is very popular at Google
and Facebook research.
