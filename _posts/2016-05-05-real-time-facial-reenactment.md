# Face2Face: Real-Time Facial Reenactment

In computer animation, animating human faces is an art itself, but transferring expressions from one human to someone else is an even more complex task. One has to take into consideration the geometry, the reflectance properties, pose, and the illumination of both faces, and make sure that mouth movements and wrinkles are transferred properly. The fact that the human eye is very keen on catching artificial changes makes the problem even more difficult. This paper describes a real-time solution to this animation problem.
