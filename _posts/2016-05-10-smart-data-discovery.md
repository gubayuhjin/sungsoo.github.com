# Smart Data Discovery 

## Hadoop-Based or Big Data Discovery
 
 *Hadoop-based data discovery* enables business users to explore and find insights across diverse data (such as clickstreams, social, sensor and transaction data) that is stored and managed in Hadoop. 
It enables users to *directly* query the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) without the extensive modeling required by traditional SQL-based approaches, the specialized skills to generate custom MapReduce, Hive or Pig queries, or the performance penalty of querying Hadoop through Hive. 
Vendors like **Platfora, Datameer, FICO, Oracle, MicroStrategy, Pentaho** and **IBM** are offering ways for users to directly explore data in Hadoop. Most data discovery and BI vendors offer access to Hadoop through Hive/HBase.

## Graph-Based Data Discovery

 *Graph-based data discovery* provides a set of analytic techniques that enable business users to visually explore relationships between entities of interest, such as organizations, people and transactions. Connections may be explicit or inferred â€” indicating, for example, the strength of a relationship or influence, frequency of interaction, or probability of fraud. Analytics can be *descriptive* (aPriori, clustering and outlier detection), *diagnostic* (Bayesian reasoning), *predictive* (Markov chains, discrete-event simulation) or *prescriptive* (graph optimization and routing). Once a graph is generated using size, color, shape and direction to represent relationship and node attributes, the user has the ability to interact directly with the graph elements to find insights.

## Visual-Based Data Discovery

 *Visual data discovery* is a BI platform architectural style that blends data from multiple sources into a proprietary *in-memory store* that is tightly coupled with an interactive visualization layer. It contrasts with the traditional BI platform, which relies on a more modular architecture dependent on three distinct technologies to integrate, store and present data. Visual-based data discovery is a **combination** of *in-memory analytics* and *interactive visualization* technologies. It includes interactive visualization technology that enables the exploration of data via the manipulation of chart images, with the color, brightness, size, shape and motion of visual objects representing aspects of the dataset being analyzed. These tools enable users to analyze data by interacting with visual representations of it. They also provide an array of visualization options that go beyond those of pie, bar and line charts, including heat and tree maps, geographic maps, scatter plots and other special-purpose visuals.
