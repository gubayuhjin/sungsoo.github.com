# Smart Data Discovery 

*Smart data discovery* is a next-generation data discovery capability that provides insights from advanced analytics to business users or citizen data scientists without requiring them to have traditional data scientist expertise.

## Examples [Market]      

The convergence is already underway, with each data discovery type providing features of the others.

* Many smart data discovery tools, such as **DataRPM**, run directly on Hadoop/Spark and/or can access data (some directly) in Hadoop as a data source. They feature a *natural-language query interface* (one element of *search-based data discovery*) and interactive visualization (a hallmark of *visual-based data discovery*).

* Most search-based data discovery tools, such as **Oracle Endeca Information Discovery**, **Incorta** and **ThoughtSpot**, also offer *visual-based data discovery*.  
     
* Some smart data discovery tools, such as **Ayasdi** and **DataRPM**, leverage *graph analysis* to relate entities and identify important relationships.

* Most *graph-based data discovery* vendors, such as **Cambridge Semantics** and **Centrifuge Systems**, offer *interactive visualization* to explore relationships.

* All *Hadoop-based data discovery* vendors, such as **Platfora** and **Datameer**, offer *visual exploration*.

* Most *visual-based data discovery* vendors, such as **MicroStrategy Visual Insight**, **Tableau**, **Qlik** and **TIBCO Spotfire**, access data in Hadoop, as well as other sources with roadmaps for expanded support.

* Many *visual-based data discovery* vendors have *natural-language query* (for example, **Qlik**, **IBM Watson Analytics** and **Microsoft PowerBI**) and some offer automated pattern detection or *smart data discovery* (**SAS Visual Analytics** and **IBM Watson Analytics**) as capabilities that they plan to mature over time.

## Hadoop-Based or Big Data Discovery
 
 *Hadoop-based data discovery* enables business users to explore and find insights across diverse data (such as clickstreams, social, sensor and transaction data) that is stored and managed in Hadoop. 
It enables users to *directly* query the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) without the extensive modeling required by traditional SQL-based approaches, the specialized skills to generate custom MapReduce, Hive or Pig queries, or the performance penalty of querying Hadoop through Hive. 
Vendors like **Platfora, Datameer, FICO, Oracle, MicroStrategy, Pentaho** and **IBM** are offering ways for users to directly explore data in Hadoop. Most data discovery and BI vendors offer access to Hadoop through Hive/HBase.

## Graph-Based Data Discovery

 *Graph-based data discovery* provides a set of analytic techniques that enable business users to visually explore relationships between entities of interest, such as organizations, people and transactions. Connections may be explicit or inferred â€” indicating, for example, the strength of a relationship or influence, frequency of interaction, or probability of fraud. Analytics can be *descriptive* (aPriori, clustering and outlier detection), *diagnostic* (Bayesian reasoning), *predictive* (Markov chains, discrete-event simulation) or *prescriptive* (graph optimization and routing). Once a graph is generated using size, color, shape and direction to represent relationship and node attributes, the user has the ability to interact directly with the graph elements to find insights.

## Visual-Based Data Discovery

 *Visual data discovery* is a BI platform architectural style that blends data from multiple sources into a proprietary *in-memory store* that is tightly coupled with an interactive visualization layer. It contrasts with the traditional BI platform, which relies on a more modular architecture dependent on three distinct technologies to integrate, store and present data. Visual-based data discovery is a **combination** of *in-memory analytics* and *interactive visualization* technologies. It includes interactive visualization technology that enables the exploration of data via the manipulation of chart images, with the color, brightness, size, shape and motion of visual objects representing aspects of the dataset being analyzed. These tools enable users to analyze data by interacting with visual representations of it. They also provide an array of visualization options that go beyond those of pie, bar and line charts, including heat and tree maps, geographic maps, scatter plots and other special-purpose visuals.
