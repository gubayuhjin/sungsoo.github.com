# The Emergence of Converged Data Platforms and the Role of In Memory Computing 

Organizations today typically have *heterogeneous* IT infrastructures which include a variety of database technologies and a wide variety of applications drawing on that data. Many organizations are dealing with massive and rapidly growing amounts of data with end users requiring immediate access to this real-time big data for both *transactional* and *BI applications*. Technology providers are responding to these evolving needs by moving towards a converged data platform which includes:

- A distributed grid/cache
- NoSQL database integration
- Relational operational database integration
- Analytic database integration
- Hadoop integration
- Stream processing
- Containerization

In this webinar, Matt Aslett from 451 Research will discuss the drivers behind the need for a converged data platform and the current state of the evolution of these solutions.

Nikita Ivanov from GridGain Systems will then discuss the role of *in-memory computing* within the *converged data platform* and describe example use cases.
