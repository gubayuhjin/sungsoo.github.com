# SIGGRAPH 2016 – Technical Papers Trailer

Preview the SIGGRAPH 2016 Technical Papers program! The SIGGRAPH Technical Papers program is the premier international forum for disseminating new scholarly work in computer graphics and interactive techniques. At the conference, paper authors provide brief overviews of their work in Technical Papers Fast Forward, then they present their complete papers in 22-minute sessions that include three minutes of Q&A.

Technical Papers are published as a special issue of ACM Transactions on Graphics. In addition to papers selected by the SIGGRAPH 2016 Technical Papers Jury, the conference presents papers that have been published in ACM Transactions on Graphics during the past year.
