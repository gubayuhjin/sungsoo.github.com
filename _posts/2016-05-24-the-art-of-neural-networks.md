# The Art of Neural Networks

Did you know that art and technology can produce fascinating results when combined? Mike Tyka, who is both artist and computer scientist, talks about the power of neural networks. These algorithms are capable to transform computers into artists that can generate breathtaking paintings, music and even poetry.

Dr. Mike Tyka studied Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of Bristol. He obtained his Ph.D. in Biophysics in 2007 and went on to work as a research fellow at the University of Washington, studying the structure and dynamics of protein molecules. In particular, he has been interested in protein folding and has been writing computer simulation software to better understand this fascinating process.

In 2009, Mike and a team of artists created Groovik’s Cube, a 35 feet tall, functional, multi-player Rubik’s cube. Since then, he co-founded ATLSpace, an artist studio in Seattle and has been creating metal and glass sculptures of protein molecules. In 2013 Mike went to Google to study neural networks, both artificial and natural. This work naturally spilled over to his artistic interests, exploring the possibilities of artificial neural networks for creating art.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at [http://ted.com/tedx](http://ted.com/tedx)
