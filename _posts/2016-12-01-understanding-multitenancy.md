Join us as we take a deep dive into the architecture of the Salesforce platform, explain how multitenancy actually works, and how it affects you as a developer. Showing the technology we use and the design principles we adhere to, you'll see how our platform teams manage three major upgrades a year without causing any issues to existing development. We'll cover the performance and security implications around the platform to give you an understanding of how limits have evolved. By the end of the session you'll have a better grasp of the architecture underpinning Force.com and understand how to get the most out of it.
