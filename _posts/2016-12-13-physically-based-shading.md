# Introduction to "Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice"

## Abstract

"Physics and Math of Shading" - Physically based shading models are increasingly important in both film and game production. This talk (presented by Naty Hoffman as part of the SIGGRAPH 2015 course, "Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice") provides an introduction to the topic, describing the underlying physics and showing how it relates to the mathematical models used for shading.
