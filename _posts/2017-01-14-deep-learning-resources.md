Deep Learning Resources 
=========

The following tutorials, videos, blogs, and papers are excellent
resources for additional study before, during, and after the class.
 Note: [6.S094](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu) is designed for people who are new to programming, machine
learning, and robotics. The following are optional resources
for longer-term study of the subject.

Getting Started
---------------

-   **Python:** [Interactive Python
    Tutorial](http://www.learnpython.org/) is a
    fast-paced, broad-ranging, and fun interactive introduction and
    overview of Python.
-   **Machine Learning with Python**: [Practical Machine Learning
    Tutorial with Python
    Introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/) is
    an in-depth but  very accessible introduction to machine
    learning. You can skip ahead to the [Neural Networks
    part](https://pythonprogramming.net/neural-networks-machine-learning-tutorial/) if
    you’re already comfortable with basics of regression,
    classification, clustering, and general data wrangling
-   **Self-Driving Cars:** The [Wikipedia article on autonomous
    cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Classification)
    is a quick overview of the technology and policy side, and [The
    First Look at How Google’s Self-Driving Car Handles City
    Streets](http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/04/first-look-how-googles-self-driving-car-handles-city-streets/8977/) is
    an fun write-up on the real-world result of one of
    its implementations.

Deep Learning
-------------

-   [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) – An
    excellent comprehensive textbook on deep learning. Up to this point,
    the review of deep learning fundamentals have been spread across
    multiple books, papers, and blogs. Now it’s all together in
    one place.
-   [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
    Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/) – While this Stanford class
    is presumably focused on computer vision, it happens to have the
    hands down best introduction to deep learning I’ve seen anywhere
    both in its notes and its video lectures.
-   [Andrej Karpathy blog](http://karpathy.github.io/) – One of the
    instructors of CS231n keeps a [great
    blog](http://karpathy.github.io/) with should be required reading
    for all interested in machine learning because its very digestable,
    entertaining, and doesn’t hold back on the messy details.

Deep Reinforcement Learning
---------------------------

-   [Demystifying Deep Reinforcement
    Learning](https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/)
-   [Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
-   [DeepMind Blog: Deep Reinforcement
    Learning](https://deepmind.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/)

Recurrent Neural Networks
-------------------------

-   [WildML Recurrent Neural Networks
    Tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/)
-   [Tensorflow RNN
    Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/recurrent/)
-   [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
    Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
-   [Anyone Can Learn To Code an LSTM-RNN in
    Python](https://iamtrask.github.io//2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/)

Autonomous Vehicles and ADAS
----------------------------

-   [Stanley: The Robot that Won the DARPA Grand
    Challenge (PDF)](http://isl.ecst.csuchico.edu/DOCS/darpa2005/DARPA%202005%20Stanley.pdf) –
    A 2006 paper from the Stanford team behind Stanley, the autonomous
    car that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.
-   [Tartan Racing: A Multi-Modal Approach to the DARPA Urban
    Challenge](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=6906)
    – A 2007 paper from the CMU team that won the 2007 DARPA
    Urban Challenge.
-   [The First Look at How Google’s Self-Driving Car Handles City
    Streets](http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/04/first-look-how-googles-self-driving-car-handles-city-streets/8977/)
