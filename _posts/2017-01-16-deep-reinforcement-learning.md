## Prerequisites

This course will assume some familiarity with reinforcement learning,
numerical optimization and machine learning. Students who are not
familiar with the concepts below are encouraged to brush up using the
references provided right below this list. We’ll review this material in
class, but it will be rather cursory.

-   Reinforcement learning and MDPs
    -   Definition of MDPs
    -   Exact algorithms: policy and value iteration
    -   Search algorithms
-   Numerical Optimization
    -   gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent
    -   backpropagation algorithm
-   Machine Learning
    -   Classification and regression problems: what loss functions are
        used, how to fit linear and nonlinear models
    -   Training/test error, overfitting.
