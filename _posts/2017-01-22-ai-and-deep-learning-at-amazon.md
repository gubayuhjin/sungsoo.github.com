AI and Deep Learning at Amazon
========

## AWS re:Invent 2016: Machine Learning State of the Union Mini Con (MAC206)

### Abstract

With the growing number of business cases for *artificial intelligence* (AI), *machine learning* (ML) and *deep learning* (DL) continue to drive the development of cutting edge technology solutions. We see this manifested in computer vision, predictive modeling, natural language understanding, and recommendation engines. During this full afternoon of sessions and workshops, learn how you can develop your own applications to leverage the benefits of these services. Join this State of the Union presentation to hear more about ML and DL at AWS and see how Motorola Solutions is leveraging these state-of-the-art technologies to solve public safety challenges, and how Ohio Health intends to inject AI into the medical system.
