Adaptive Machine Learning for Real-Time Streaming
========


### Abstract

Direct processing of real-time data can provide a crucial edge in the software-and-services industry. Combining such processing with machine learning can provide a reasoning flow and enable runtime updates of the machine-learning model. Customer scenarios in manufacturing and IT services will benefit.

## Adaptive Learning: The Next Generation of Machine Intelligence

### Abstract
Adaptive learning optimizes both human and machine learning, to maximize the accuracy of scalable data processing as efficiently as possible. For the auto-industry, adaptive learning is 95% accurate in predicting when social media communications are about purchasing cars, which correlates with actual monthly car sales for the majority models of cars we have investigated.

### About the speaker:

Rob drives the Idibon's vision and strategic direction. He is a leader in applying big data analytics to human communications, having worked in diverse environments, from Sierra Leone, Haiti and the Amazon to London, Sydney and San Francisco. He completed a PhD in Computational Linguistics as a Graduate Fellow at Stanford University. Outside of work, he learned about the worldâ€™s diversity by cycling more than 20,000 kilometers across 20 countries.

## Adaptive learning rates for each connection

Lecture from the course Neural Networks for Machine Learning, as taught by Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto) on Coursera in 2012.
