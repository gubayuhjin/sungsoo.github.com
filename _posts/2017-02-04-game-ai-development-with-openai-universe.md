Game AI Development with OpenAI Universe
===

Universe allows an AI agent to use a computer like a human does: by looking at screen pixels and operating a virtual keyboard and mouse. We must train AI systems on the full range of tasks we expect them to solve, and Universe lets us train a single agent on any task a human can complete with a computer.

In April, we [launched Gym](https://openai.com/blog/openai-gym-beta/), a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. With Universe, any program can be turned into a Gym environment. Universe works by automatically launching the program behind a VNC remote desktop â€” it doesn't need special access to program internals, source code, or bot APIs.
