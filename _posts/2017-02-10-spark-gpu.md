## Abstract

Apache Spark is an *in-memory data processing system* that supports both SQL queries and advanced analytics over large data sets. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of Spark-GPU that enables Spark to utilize GPUâ€™s massively parallel processing ability to achieve both high performance and high throughput. Spark-GPU transforms a general-purpose data processing system into a GPU-supported system by addressing several real-world technical challenges including minimizing internal and external data transfers, preparing a suitable data format and a batching mode for efficient GPU execution, and determining the suitability of workloads for GPU with a *task scheduling capability* between CPU and GPU. We have comprehensively evaluated Spark-GPU with a set of representative analytical workloads to show its effectiveness. Our results show that Spark-GPU improves the performance of machine learning workloads by up to 16.13x and the performance of SQL queries by up to 4.83x.
