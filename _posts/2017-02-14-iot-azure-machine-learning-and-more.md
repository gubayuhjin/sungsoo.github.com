IoT, Azure, Machine Learning & more
===

In this video Scott Hanselman delivers one of the best and personal demos, he'll show you how a combined solution using technologies such as *IoT devices, cloud platforms, Machine Learning* and Office API's can come together to solve even the most complex problems.

The HealthClinic.biz demo used in the video can be found in the repo at [https://github.com/Microsoft/HealthClinic.biz](https://github.com/Microsoft/HealthClinic.biz/) The samples in the repo are used to present an end-to-end demo scenario based on a fictitious B2B and multitenant system, named "HealthClinic.biz" that provides different websites, mobile apps, wearable apps, and services running on the latest Microsoft and open technologies.
