Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Nets
===

## Abstract

We investigate *conditional adversarial networks* as a general-purpose solution to *image-to-image translation problems*. These networks not only learn the *mapping* from input image to output image, but also learn a *loss function* to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.
