Three things you need to know about machine learning 
====================================================

[Machine learning is all the
rage](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-new-artificial-intelligence-market), and [major
improvements](https://ai100.stanford.edu/2016-report) in infrastructure, data storage, and cloud adoption
have led to growing interest in the space. Many consumer-facing
advancements [reside within Google and
Facebook](http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/), but other companies are investing in the field as
well. However, given all the excitement around machine learning, it’s
important to understand some of the nuances and mechanics of what
machine learning is and how it works. As an investor at Redpoint
Ventures, I have the privilege of learning from people and companies on
the cutting edge of this technology.

So, what is machine learning and artificial intelligence? Artificial
intelligence (AI) is software that does what humans do but faster and
hopefully better. For example, transcribing notes from a meeting and
highlighting all follow up tasks. Machine learning is one approach to
achieve AI by using algorithms, instead of the traditional hand-coded
rules-based decision trees. At a high level, there are three steps in
machine learning: sensing, reasoning, and producing.

Machine learning has increased in popularity and become more feasible in
the last five years.

There have been several advancements in the field of machine learning
that have driven improvements in techniques, applications, and the
overall accessibility of the technique such as the rise of cloud
computing and the proliferation of data.

There are four major factors that have led to the current proliferation
of companies that are leveraging machine learning in their products.

The machine learning landscape and its potential for impact on products
and services in the future can be viewed in three specific ways:

## Takeway #1: *Machine learning is not monolithic*

Within machine learning, there are different types of learning (e.g.,
supervised, unsupervised) and various techniques (e.g., regression,
neural nets). These techniques and types of learning do not exclusively
map to each other but are used in different combinations depending on
the situation. Below I’ve shared how I visually mapped this out for myself.

### Types of learning:

- **Supervised:** Supervised learning identifies patterns in data given pre-determined features and labeled data (e.g., traditional insurance underwriting)
- **Unsupervised:** Unsupervised learning identifies patterns in data, which is particularly helpful for unlabeled and unstructured data (e.g., Gmail spam)
- **Semi-supervised:** A blend of supervised and unsupervised learning. Best in situations where there is some labeled data but not a lot (e.g., customer segmentation)
- **Reinforcement:** Reinforcement learning provides feedback to the
    algorithm as it trains; it is essentially experience-driven decision
    making (e.g., playing chess)

## Takeaway #2: *Deep learning has emerged as a technique with strong advantages, but also has important drawbacks as well*

Deep learning involves many layers of neural nets, algorithms modeled on
the structure of the human brain, making the network “deep.” We often
hear about the benefits of deep learning for unsupervised and
reinforcement learning, which has in fact led to major advancements in
both fields, although it is not always required. Deep learning may also
be valuable in supervised learning with large, complex problems.

Deep learning has three key advantages relative to other techniques. It
is robust, generalizable, and scalable. It is *robust* because the
features, the characteristics used to differentiate or classify the
data, do not need to be predetermined; the optimal features are learned
for a given task. It is *generalizable* because the same neural net
approach can be used for different applications and data types. And it
is *scalable* because the method is 1) parallelizable, i.e., able to be
run across multiple processors and 2) performance improves with more
data, reducing the likelihood of that you will train the algorithm in a
way that is accurate for only the specific training data (i.e.,
overfitting).

This has important consequences for three fields in particular: natural
language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

At the same time, there are drawbacks to keep in mind when using deep
learning. One big one is that when a neural net determines certain
features are important and makes decisions based on them, we do not know
why. This means that if there is corrupted data or human bias in the
system, we will not be able to pinpoint that it exists, which can be
dangerous for specific use cases, such as various areas of finance and
law enforcement, that could impact society.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*a1FQyxI1inMG2FiS.)

In addition, deep learning models require an extremely large amount of
data and compute power to be effective, which is costly and time
intensive. This is an important tradeoff to keep in mind, especially for
young startups who are building their products on a budget.

Therefore, deep learning is not always the best approach, but rather,
for each specific use case, data scientists need to take the potential
for bias, availability of computing resources, and access to data into
account.

## Takeaway #3: *Machine learning will have major implications for what products will look like going forward*

Machine learning is not a solution in and of itself, but a tool to
optimize the desired outcome. Therefore companies leveraging machine
learning should focus on providing insights that are actionable, and
move from helping customers manipulate data for analysis to focusing on
strategy and recommendations to make decision making more efficient and
accurate. It’s likely that user interfaces will simplify to focus on
recommending an action instead of providing a myriad of options to pick
from. Below are two examples that illustrate early versions of this
shift.

Facebook’s photo tagging engine has moved to recommended tagging (left),
making it smarter and simpler to use than its previous version (right).

Similarly, Google Now remembers where a user parks (left) and recommends
when to leave for the airport (right) based on flight times, current
location, and traffic information. This recommendation-driven,
simplified user experience will be the future of product user
interfaces.

These examples illustrate the massive impact that machine learning will
have as it continues to enable products that are more effective and
simpler to use.
