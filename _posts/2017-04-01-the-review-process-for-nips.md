The Review Process for NIPS 2016 
================================

In an effort to bring transparency to the NIPS 2016 reviewing process,
we describe in this page the main steps and the new features we
implemented. This is the result of the joint effort of the program
chairs (Ulrike von Luxburg and Isabelle Guyon) and the program team
([Krikamol Muandet](http://www.krikamol.org/) andÂ [Behzad
Tabibian](http://btabibian.com/), partly also [Rohit
Babbar](https://sites.google.com/site/rohitbabbar/)). We are most
grateful to our [100 Area
Chairs](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Committees) and the [3400
Reviewers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Reviewers) for all their
input and support. We are much indebted to Neil Lawrence for sharing his
scripts from the NIPS 2014 conference (documented in his
[blog](http://inverseprobability.com/blog)). Thanks also to the [NIPS
Board](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Board) for their input, though
they may not endorse everything we did, and the [CMT support
team](https://cmt.research.microsoft.com). Last but not least, thanks to
all the 6000 authors who contributed their time to prepare alltogether
2500 papers for this year's NIPS. We hope to see many of you at the
conference!

Our design of the NIPS 2016 review process follows two main guiding
principles:

-   Ensuring the *program quality*.
-   Inventing *new procedures* that will scale with the ever-growing
    numbers of submissions.

Selection of Area Chairs
------------------------

Area Chairs (ACs) are the backbone of the NIPS reviewing process. Each
AC typically handles 20-30 submissions. Hence, we needed to recruit
about 100 area chairs. As it is impossible to intimately know all the
diverse research areas covered by NIPS, we came up with the following
procedure:

1.  We asked the NIPS Board and all ACs of the last two NIPS conferences
    to nominate potential ACs for this year. In this way, we covered the
    whole variety of NIPS topics, and obtained qualified suggestions. We
    obtained around 350 suggestions.
2.  We asked the NIPS Board to go through the list of suggested ACs to
    vote in favor of suggested ACs.
3.  We accounted for the distribution of subject areas of submitted
    papers of the previous NIPS conference.
4.  Combining all this input we compiled a final list of ACs, by the end
    of January we had recruited exactly 100 ACs.
5.  In a later step, we formed "buddy pairs" among the ACs. Based on the
    ACs preferences, each AC got assigned a "buddy AC". These buddy
    teams were important in the decision process (see below).

Selection of Reviewers
----------------------

The process of recruiting reviewers is very time consuming, it
essentially went on from January until the submission deadline end of
May. New this year, we had two kinds of reviewers, "invited senior
reviewers" and "volunteer reviewers":

1.  **Invited Experienced Reviewers:** We asked all ACs to suggest at
    least 30 reviewers each who have completed the PhD degree. We
    obtained 2500 suggested experienced reviewers. We invited all of
    them, and 1100 accepted. We then asked all confirmed reviewers to
    "clone themselves" by inviting at least one researcher with a
    similar research background and at least as good qualification
    as themselves. This resulted in another 500 experienced reviewers.
2.  **Volunteer Author-Reviewers:** An obvious procedure to let the
    number of reviewers scale with the number of submissions is to ask
    authors to become reviewers as well. This idea has been used in the
    past, for example to [evaluate NSF grant
    proposals](http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2014/07/want-grant-first-review-someone-elses-proposal)
    or to [allocate telescope
    time](http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/4/4.16.short).
    To implement this idea, without constraining unwilling authors, we
    requested authors to volunteer during the submission process by
    naming at least one author as "volunteer reviewer". We ended up with
    3000 nominations. The next day we invited all of them formally
    through CMT, and about 2000 of the volunteers accepted the
    invitation and were involved in the review process. One of the nice
    effect of including author-reviewers was to add transparency to the
    review process as at least one author per paper experienced it.

An obvious difficulty was that we could not control the quality of the
volunteer author-reviewers. We addressed this by keeping invited
reviewers and volunteer reviewers in two separate pools. In the end, we
had the following number of reviewers:


-   Pool 1: Invited experienced reviewers:
    -   senior researcher / faculty: 930
    -   junior researcher / postdoc: 600
-   Pool 2: Volunteer author-reviewers:
    -   senior researcher / faculty: 400
    -   junior researcher / postdoc: 250
    -   PhD students: 1200

Paper Submission
----------------

We received about **2500 papers** by the submission deadline. As is often
the case, most submissions were made right before the deadline:

![Submission timeline](http://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/team/luxburg/misc/nips2016/NIPS_plots/submission.png)

*The deadline was strictly enforced*, regardless of personal situations,
we are sorry for those who missed it. During the next couple of weeks, a
number of papers were withdrawn or deleted by the authors (for example,
because they had been submitted twice, or remained unfinished at the
time of the deadline). By the end of the review process, we were left
with **2406 submitted papers**.

Paper Assignment to Area Chairs
-------------------------------

The assignment of papers to Area Chairs was a multi-step procedure:

1.  A first similarity score between all ACs and all submitted papers
    was computed based on subject areas and the Toronto paper
    matching scores.
2.  Additionally, ACs could bid for papers they wanted to handle.
3.  Then papers were assigned automatically, taking into account the
    similarity scores and the bidding scores.
4.  Finally, ACs could decline handling certain papers for miscellaneous
    reasons, including conflicts of interest. These papers were
    re-assigned by hand by the program chairs.


Paper Assignment to Reviewers
-----------------------------

The assignment of papers to reviewers was largely new this year:


1.  The AC of each paper was responsible to first assign one senior,
    highly qualified reviewer "by hand" (either from Pool 1 or at the
    discretion of the AC).
2.  Two more invited reviewers (from Pool 1) were assigned automatically
    to each paper, using a combination of subject similarity, reviewer's
    bidding preferences, and similarity scores computed by the Toronto
    paper matching service.
3.  Three volunteer reviewers (from Pool 2) were assigned automatically
    to each paper by a similar procedure as in Step 2.
4.  The ACs were asked to check whether each of their assigned papers
    had at least 3 really competent reviewers, and could manually change
    reviewer assignments (either from Pool 1 or at their discretion) to
    ensure that this is the case.
5.  During the decision process, additional "emergency reviewers" were
    invited to provide complementary reviews if some of the reviewers
    defected or no concensus could be reached among the
    selected reviewers.

Review Profiling
----------------

In the end, we received 13,674 reviews from 3242 reviewers. On average,
each reviewer provided 4.05 reviews, and *each paper was reviewed 5.97
times*:

Scoring Method
--------------

We completely changed the scoring method this year. In previous years,
NIPS papers were rated using a single score between 1 and 10. This did
not allow reviewers to give a differentiated quantitative appreciation
on various aspect of paper quality. Furthermore, the role of the ACs was
implicitly to combine the decisions of the reviewers (late integration)
rather than combining the reviews to make the final decision (early
integration). Introducing multiple scores allowed us to better separate
the roles: the reviewers were in charge of evaluating the papers; the
ACs were in charge of making (rational) decisions based on all the
evaluations. Furthermore the multiple specialized scores allowed the ACs
to guide reviewers to focus discussions on "facts" rather than "opinion"
in the discussion phase. We asked reviewers to provide a score in each
of the following categories:

-   *Technical quality*
-   *Novelty/originality*
-   *Potential impact or usefulness*
-   *Clarity and presentation*

The grades were on a scale 1-5:
-   5 - Award level (1/1000 submissions)
-   4 - Oral level (top 3% submissions)
-   3 - Poster level (top 30% submissions)
-   2 - Sub-standard for NIPS
-   1 - Low or very low


We also asked the reviewers to flag "fatal flaws" and declare their
overall "level of confidence". The scores had to be complemented by
justifications in designated text boxes.

The following histograms show the distribution of average scores for all
papers (where the average is taken over all reviews for each paper).

![score statistics](http://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/team/luxburg/misc/nips2016/NIPS_plots/decision1.png)

The ACs were given a lot of flexibility to use the scores. In
particular, the decisions were not based on thresholding an overall
score (we did not even attempt to compute such an overall score). The
text explanations in the reviews, the rebuttal, and the discussions
among reviewers played an important role.

Author rebuttal and discussions
-------------------------------

Once most of the reviews were in, all authors had the possibility to
look at the reviews and write a rebuttal (some reviews were still
missing at this point, but it would not have helped to delay the
rebuttal deadline, the missing reviews trickled in slowly).
Subsequently, area chairs and reviewers engaged in detailed discussions
about the pros and cons of the submitted papers. To support the ACs, we
sent individual reports to all area chairs to flag papers whose reviews
were of too low confidence, too high variance or where reviews were
still missing. In many cases, area chairs recruited additional emergency
reviewers to increase the overall quality of the decisions.


Decisions
---------

Two novel elements were introduced this year in the decision process:

-   No conference calls between ACs and program-chairs: we introduced a
    *decentralized*, *scalable decision process* relying on AC buddy-pairs.
-   No poster spotlights. Instead we doubled the number of oral
    presentations by introducing two tracks.


The decision process was largely based on AC "*buddy*" suggestions. The
first round of decisions happened in a moderated, but decentralized
fashion: each area chair worked with her/his "buddy". The two of them
were responsible for all papers in their joint bag, and made their
decisions jointly, following guidelines given by the program chairs.
Difficult cases were taken to the program chairs (among them, cases
conflicts of interest and plagiarism). To harmonize decisions across
buddy pairs, all area chairs had access to various statistics and
histograms over the set of their papers and the set of all submitted
papers. In a second round, the program chairs consolidated the
decisions. This mainly affected the selection of oral presentations,
with the goal to exhibit the diversity of NIPS papers and to expose the
community with novel and thought provoking ideas. All in all, 568 papers
got accepted to the conference, among them 46 oral presentations.


Below is a plot of the distribution per subject areas (combined primary
and secondary subjects), both for submitted papers and for accepted
papers. Of course the proportions are not identical, but the plots do
not show any systematic bias in favor or against certain areas.

Exhibition of rejected papers
-----------------------------

With a review process of this scale it is unavoidable that among the
rejected papers there are hidden gems that simply drowned in the review
process. For this reason we organized an [exhibition of rejected
papers](http://salon-des-refuses.org/), in a spirit similar to the
[Salon de
RefuesÃ©s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_des_Refus%C3%A9s). In this
exhibition, you can find a list of those rejected NIPS submissions whose
authors decided to take part in the exhibition.
