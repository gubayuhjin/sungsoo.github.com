Fast Data at Internet Scale with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
===

Database performance is a key factor for keeping your app running fast. As the amount of data and request throughput grow, it becomes harder to keep it nimble and performant. In this webinar, we will discuss using **Redis**, a popular *NoSQL key-value store*, to run your data fast at scale. Redis can be used as a cache in front of a database or as a fast in-memory data store. We will also cover how you can use ElastiCache for Redis to easily set up a large multi-terabyte Redis environment and operate it with zero management.
