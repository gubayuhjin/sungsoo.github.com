# Deep Advances in Generative Modeling

## Abstract

In recent years, deep learning approaches have come to dominate *discriminative problems* in many sub-areas of machine learning. Alongside this, they have also powered exciting improvements in *generative* and *conditional modeling* of richly structured data such as text, images, and audio. 

This talk, led by indico's Head of Research, Alec Radford, will serve as an introduction to several emerging application areas of *generative modeling* and provide a survey of recent techniques in the field.
