# Analysis and Prediction of Spatiotemporal Traffic Congestion

## Abstract

*Traffic congestion* impedes our mobility, pollutes the air, wastes fuel, and hampers economic growth. While physical bottlenecks, overpopulation, weather, and construction can all lead to congestion, a key contributor to traffic congestion is *road accidents* - events that disrupt the normal flow of traffic. Reducing the impact of traffic accidents has been one of the primary objectives for transportation policy makers. In this talk, we present a *novel machine learning framework* to forecast how travel-time delays - caused by accidents - occur and progress in the transportation network. This research is conducted <font color="blue">by correlating 4 years of historical traffic sensor and accident data</font> archived under ADMS project developed - by METRANS and IMSC centers of USC - for Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).
