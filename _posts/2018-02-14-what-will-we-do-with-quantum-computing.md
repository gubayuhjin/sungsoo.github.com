# What Will We Do With Quantum Computing?

- Aram Harrow, MIT


## Abstract

A large-scale quantum computer would be able to solve problems that existing classical computers would take much longer than the age of the universe to solve. This would have dramatic implications for cryptography, chemistry, material science, nuclear physics and probably other areas that are still unknown. But what about quantum computers that will be available in the next few years?
