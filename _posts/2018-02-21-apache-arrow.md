# Using Apache Arrow, Calcite and Parquet to build a Relational Cache

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and *zero-copy streaming messaging* and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
