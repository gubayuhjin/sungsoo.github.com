## Abstract

We study the problem of 3D object generation. We propose a novel
framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which
generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent
advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial
nets. The benefits of our model are three-fold: first, the use of an
adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria,
enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to
synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator establishes a
mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D
objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD
models, and explore the 3D object manifold; third, the adversarial
discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned
without supervision, has wide applications in 3D object recognition.
Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D
objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive
performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of
supervised learning methods.
