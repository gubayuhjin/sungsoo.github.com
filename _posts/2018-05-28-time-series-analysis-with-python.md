## Time Series Analysis 

*Time series analysis* is more relevant than ever with the rise of big data, the internet of things, and the general availability of data that follows events through time. This tutorial will introduce participants to the many versatile tools Python offers for exploring, analyzing, and predicting time series data. The tutorial will be a mix of lecture and practice, and it will be broken down into four components:

 (1) Handling timestamped data in Python 
 (2) Commonly encountered problems with time series 
 (3) Time series prediction exercises 
 (4) Time series classification exercises
