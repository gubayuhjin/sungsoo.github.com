\begin{abstract}
This technical report explores the main concepts and components of business intelligence anddecision support systems that gather, generate, and present information for businessdecision makers, focusing especially on the use of \textit{data warehouses}.
Data are crucial raw material in this information age, and data storage and management havebecome the focus of database design and implementation.
The data warehouse extracts or obtains itsdata from operational databases as well as from external sources, providing a morecomprehensive data pool.
